* Quick note:

The patch files are already applied inside the source code. An example config file is also included. 

* Source:

[Jean-Fran√ßois Moine](http://moinejf.free.fr/)'s blog (This guy deleted it)

* Future work (already in progress):

1) Adding NanoPi M1 dts file inside the kernel tree.

2) Adding H3 DRM driver inside the kernel tree (part of Wayland support).



UPDATE: Just found an old Out-Of-Tree folder for compiling HDMI in 4.7rc1 kernel, from Mr. Moine's old files. And its HDMI works perfectly as opposed to the one published recently as a single patch. Going to make some studies of what makes the new patches' HDMI don't work in NanoPi M1 and OPI-PC and will let you posted.
